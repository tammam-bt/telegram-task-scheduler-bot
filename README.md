## üìÖ Smart Calendar Operations

The bot's core functionality revolves around intelligent calendar management through natural language processing. Here's what you can accomplish:

### üìù Create Events
Transform natural language into calendar events instantly. Simply describe when and what you want to schedule, and the AI will parse the details to create a properly formatted calendar event.

**Examples:**
- "Schedule a meeting with the marketing team tomorrow at 2 PM"
- "Book dentist appointment next Friday at 10:30 AM"
- "Create a reminder for mom's birthday on December 25th"

### ‚úèÔ∏è Update Events
Modify existing calendar events using conversational language. The AI understands context and can identify which event you want to change based on your description.

**Examples:**
- "Move my dentist appointment to next Wednesday at 3 PM"
- "Change the marketing meeting to 4 PM instead"
- "Reschedule lunch with Sarah to tomorrow"

### üóëÔ∏è Delete Events
Remove events from your calendar by simply describing what you want to cancel. The bot will identify and confirm the deletion of the specified event.

**Examples:**
- "Cancel my dentist appointment on Friday"
- "Remove the team standup meeting"
- "Delete the workshop from my calendar next week"

### üìã List Events
View your upcoming events and schedule with natural queries. Ask about specific time periods or general availability.

**Examples:**
- "What do I have scheduled for tomorrow?"
- "Show me my events for next week"
- "What's on my calendar this afternoon?"

## üí¨ Natural Language Examples

Instead of complex commands, just chat naturally:

- "Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 3pm"
- "Show me my events for next week"
- "Move my dentist appointment to Friday at 2pm"
- "Cancel the team standup on Monday"
- "What do I have planned for this afternoon?"
